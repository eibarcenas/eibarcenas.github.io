# Erick Bárcenas - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio and professional cover letter, designed for hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main landing page (Portfolio).
- **`cover-letter.html`**: The professional cover letter page.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure these files are in your GitHub repository (e.g., `username.github.io`).
2. **Settings**:
   - Go to your repository **Settings**.
   - Navigate to **Pages** (sidebar).
   - Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
   - Select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and folder `/(root)`.
   - Click **Save**.
3. **Usage**:
   Since the main file is named `index.html`, your site will be accessible directly at:
   `https://<username>.github.io/`

## Design System

- **Fonts**: Inter (Body), Outfit (Headings) [via Google Fonts].
- **Style**: Dark/Navy technical aesthetic with glassmorphism effects.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive grid/flexbox layout without external CSS frameworks.
